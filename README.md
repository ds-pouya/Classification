# Classification Projects Repository
Welcome to the Classification Projects Repository! This repository hosts various projects related to classification analysis and machine learning.

## Projects
### Project 1: [Adoption vs. Euthanization using Random Forest](Animal_Shelter/AnimalShelter.ipynb) + Power BI Dashboard
- Predicting the Decision to Adopt vs. Euthanize animals in an Animal Shelter
- Determining Feature Importance
- You can find out more [here](Animal_Shelter/README.md)

## Dependencies required to run the projects.
### Python Libraries
